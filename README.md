# CSC319-Midterm-2-Review

Create a class named Class (clever, eh?)

It should describe a college course, and have attributes for the course name, course number, sections, maximum attendance, actual number of students enrolled.
Sections should be a vector of ints (holding what we call CRNs)

It should have methods to do the following:
- Print out the class (i.e. ostream override)
- Constructor that sets all of the attributes
- Override less than so that a vector of classes will sort by number of students enrolled.
- Override "+" so that it creates a new instance of class that merges the section vectors.

Upload a .cpp, a .hpp, and UML
